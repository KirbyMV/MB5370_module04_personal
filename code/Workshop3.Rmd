# Lengthening datasets

pivot data to make it tidy. pivot_longer() usually solves a lot of data problems by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.

```{r}
billboard |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank"
  )
```
cols specifies the columns you want to pivot
names_to names the variable stored in column names
values_to names the variable stored in the cell values
values_drop_na = TRUE can remove NAs that were created when pivoting simply because the data did not exist

```{r}
billboard |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```
